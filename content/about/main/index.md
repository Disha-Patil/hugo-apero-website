intro: |
  I currently work as a data scientist and have experience in building DS solution in various domains like -
  Manufacturing, Energy, Finance, Logistics, and Pharma. I have worked with teams both small and big to deliver projects in AI/ML or analytics using latest technologies. 
  I have experience in delivering NLP and CV projects where I have been deeply involved in the end-to-end process of data science projects, from problem formulation and data understanding to stakeholder communication and solution deployment. 
  I love data visualisation and I like to explore new frameworks for it. Currently I am exploring Observable.js for dataViz. I also love ggplot from R a lot. 
  I mostly code in python these days, but I am well versed in R and I have some experience with HTML/Javascript for dashboard building. I like to pick up new frameworks or languages that prove useful in my work.
  I had a small stint at academic research where I worked on mathematical modeling of glaciers. 

  Apart from my work, I love theatre. I have participated in competetive theatre during my college days. Currently part of the E-Lab 2024 cohort taught by Pradeep Vaidya. 
  I also love to cook and I am now documenting my home cooked meals.
